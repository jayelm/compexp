# Compositional Explanations of Neurons

Vision code has been released - NLI coming soon!

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14032

This codebase is split into two repositories: one for the vision experiments
(which extends the excellent [PyTorch implementation of
NetDissect](https://github.com/CSAILVision/NetDissect-Lite/tree/master/visualize)),
and one for the NLI experiments.
